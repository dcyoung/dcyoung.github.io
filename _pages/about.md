I am a passionate Engineer, applying research and building technology products. I enjoy reasoning about systems, thinking through problems and applying technology with intent to create tooling where none exists. I hold multiple engineering degrees with experience in diverse fields including Bio-medical Research, Sensor Design and Manufacture, Robotics, Automation, Document Processing, IOT & Geospatial Data Processing and Cellular Networking.

**At Work**

I have served as a visionary IC, research engineer and developer of first party software, ML and AI solutions at early and growth stage companies, spearheading many efforts related to ML including R&D, datascience and engineering.

Day to day, I foster a friendly work atmosphere that promotes passionate, curious engagement around challenging problems. I champion the pragmatic use of agile process, the appropriate introduction of automation, and the application of a product mindset.

With a focus on Deep Learning, I have identified and defined problems fit for ML, translated state-of-the-art research to production systems, and deployed scalable closed loop ML solutions to solve complex real-world challenges.

I bring a wealth of experience in robotics, computer vision, NLP and document understanding. I have also presented on vision, R&D, technology and roadmaps to diverse audiences.

I recommend interested readers visit the experience section of my website: https://dcyoung.github.io/resume/ for a more comprehensive breakdown of projects and work experience.

**At Play**

Outside of work I enjoy building things with my hands. My passion projects combine data driven design, art and engineering.

You can also find me playing music, mountain biking, motorcycling or adventuring outdoors.
