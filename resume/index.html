<p><img src="/images/logos/ripcord.svg" alt="ripcord" /></p>

<p>As the first data scientist and ML engineer at Ripcord, I served as a visionary and developer for first party ML and AI solutions. After introducing deep learning to the founding team, I led technical efforts related to ML including R&amp;D, data-science and engineering. I began by enabling the automated digitization of physical paper documents and progressed to driving the intelligent extraction and organization of information from business documents at scale. I have worked to align objectives, understand critical problems, develop novel tooling and ensure successful integration into a larger engineering effort.</p>

<p>I have identified and defined problems fit for machine learning, translated state of the art research to production systems, and deployed scalable closed loop ML solutions that have solved complex real-world challenges. These efforts in Computer Vision and NLP have enabled the intelligent scanning, organization and extraction of information from customer documents at previously unprecedented scale. I have presented on vision, R&amp;D, technology and road maps to diverse audiences including the company, investors and the board.​</p>

<p>Day to day, I foster a friendly work atmosphere that promotes passionate, curious engagement around challenging problems. I champion the pragmatic use of agile process, the appropriate introduction of automation, and the application of a product mindset.

<h2 id="scanse---director-of-software-2015-2017">Scanse - Director of software (2015-2017)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/logos/scanse.webp" alt="scanse" /></p>

<p>Scanse was a small 3 person startup attempting to democratize LiDAR: a traditionally expensive and complicated sensing component for autonomous robots, self driving cars, and environment capture. In two years, my colleagues and I designed, manufactured and shipped over 5000 hardware units with supporting software. Throughout the process we fostered an active community of builders, researchers, artists and hobbyists, continuously releasing additional documentation, open source projects and accessory products. While delivering our primary scanning product, we also prototyped new products for non-invasive indoor occupancy tracking.</p>

<p>At a small startup, you play a role in everything! However, my main focus was the design and development of interactive software for both the sensing and visualization of complex 3D data. My accomplishments included the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designed, implemented and shipped cross platform desktop application for visualizing, interpreting and interacting with realtime LiDAR data and 3D point cloud data. Primary technologies included electron and WebGL</li>
  <li>Designed and implemented a rudimentary but efficient javascript based UI component framework to update and render modified components in the DOM - before React was really a thing!</li>
  <li>Implemented and maintained SDK’s used to control LiDAR sensor in various programming languages</li>
  <li>Managed numerous contractors and external developers contributing to open software projects</li>
  <li>Supported and fostered active customer community</li>

Over the course of a week, I helped setup and deliver hundreds of HTC Vive Virtual Reality Demonstrations to interested faculty and students. I delivered marketing pitches, while also providing in-depth technical information and prolonged discussion with faculty, researchers and local businesses interested in developing experiences with the HTC Vive. Discussions included applying VR to entertainment, social networks, education, research, robotics, medical technology, data visualization and architectural visualization, as well as analysis of development obstacles unique to VR content. I generated new interest from a wide variety of demographics and highlighted new and useful industry information (problems, processes, connections, workflows, products etc) for those already working with VR.</p>

<p>In 2013 a friend and I founded AD/PC, a small business specializing in the design and fabrication of custom Personal Computers. AD/PC catered to any computer needs, but the primary clientele were undergraduate students at Washington University looking for custom water-cooled enthusiast gaming PCs. As a small part-time business AD/PC stuck to commissioned work, rarely taking on more than one or two projects at a time. Word of mouth kept AD/PC with a steady queue of interested customers until I finished undergraduate.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2013 I worked for a wealth advising firm in the San Francisco Bay Area, called Cypress Wealth Advisors. During my time there I built client databases in Microsoft Access, handled tax returns for small oil investors and developed software to automate the firm’s quarterly summary report process. The latter involved creating software in Java to parse the client database and compile information regarding individual investments before automating LaTeX to stitch together the summary reports for each of the investments relevant to a specific client. Before this, the firm was manually editing a Word Document to produce individualized summary reports which (for a few hundred clients) can take days. I also began working on a graphical interface to extend the functionality and usability of the automated summary reporting.</p>

<h2 id="la-cocina---restaurant">La Cocina - Restaurant</h2>

<p>From 2007-2011 I was employed in various positions at La Cocina, a small restaurant in my hometown. Being a waiter also assumed acting as floor manager, where my responsibilities included opening and closing the restaurant, handling the documentation and security of money, managing other staff and even assisting in the design of a new computer system for online catering orders. I include this job on my resume to highlight a history of understanding service, customers and hard work.</p>

<h2 id="barbour-laboratory-of-sensory-neuroscience-and-neuroengineering">Barbour Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience and Neuroengineering</h2>

<p>During undergrad, I worked as a research assistant in the Barbour Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience and Neuroengineering. My work involved the design and development of mobile applications to aid in Cognitive Neuro-therapeutics, specifically auditory training.</p>

<p><strong>A description directly from the website for the Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience and Neuroengineering:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our research group is fundamentally interested in how the brain encodes and processes information. The vertebrate nervous system routinely achieves feats of pattern recognition unparalleled by modern computers. The natural algorithms underlying this pattern recognition and the neuronal circuitry computing them both represent targets for research in my lab, predominantly by measuring single and bulk neuron activity in awake subjects. We are particularly interested in how complex sounds are encoded in the brain when interfering noise is present and how language is processed.</p>

  <p>In related work, we also seek to be able to manipulate brain function for therapeutic purposes. Following brain injury such as a stroke, some function is lost and the brain network is disrupted. We apply principles of system theory and neuroplasticity toward developing brain-computer interfaces that can rewire brains and thus recover the lost function. We also explore how noninvasive technologies can be employed to induce therapeutic changes in the brain. One example of this is a series of smartphone-based video games we have designed to deliver listening training. These games are intended to optimize listening skills with a hearing-assist device, such as a cochlear implant or hearing aid.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cognitive training software provides exercises whose completion strengthens certain cognitive processes. We seek to develop listening training software in the form of compelling video games playable on smartphones that naturally encourage individuals to complete their auditory training. The goal of this work is to optimize the function of hearing assist devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, as well as to enable individuals with a newly correct hearing deficit to learn to communicate effectively.</p>

<h1 id="software-development--programming-experience">Software Development &amp; Programming Experience</h1>

<p>Programming is a powerful skill, but it does not replace an understanding of customer need, a critical experiment, a solid product design, or a high level plan for system architecture.</p>

<p>Before writing a line of code, I prefer to focus on communication, design, and architecture. With a strong plan, programming is often the easiest part of the puzzle.</p>

<p>That is not to say that I haven’t gotten my hands dirty coding. I estimate I have spent <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~20k hours</code></strong> programming and developing software professionally. This experience yields some strengths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I learn very quickly and adapt to new dev environments, code bases and projects.</li>
  <li>I write extremely clean, organized and well documented code that requires very little maintenance. I aim for legibility over cryptic optimizations.</li>
  <li>I excel in technical documentation and communication.</li>
