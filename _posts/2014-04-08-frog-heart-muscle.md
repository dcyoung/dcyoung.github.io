Cardiac muscle contraction differs from skeletal muscle contraction in a few behaviors essential toproper function of the heart. Additionally, not all cardiac muscle is the same. Although frog myocardium differs from mammalian myocardium in its ionic basis of activation, it is a useful starting point in studying myocardial behavior. Different control mechanisms exist to alter the rate, power ofcontraction and stroke volume of the heart. Using an intact frog ventricle muscle and a forcetransducer, this lab explores the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol, the inhibitoryeffects of high extracellular potassium and the effects of increasing stimulus frequency on frog cardiacventricular muscle.
