A basic script to animate a capital letter "I" for the fighting Illini from UIUC. The project uses javascript and WebGL to make the letter look like it is bouncing similar to the old pixar lamp. It draws the letter using 2 triangle strips with no degenerate triangles, and then animates the movements using keyframes. Prior to this I'd never worked with graphics of any kind, so this was a very basic test to get acquainted with graphics pipeline.
