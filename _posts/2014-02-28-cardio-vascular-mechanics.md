## Notes on Diagnosing Cardiac Malfunction

Diagnosing cardiac malfunction is surprisingly simple. Pick up a copy of Dubin's "Rapid Interpretation of EKG's." By forming a simple checklist one could be well on their way to EKG pattern recognition as a method of diagnosis. While these matured methods are reliable, consistent and trustworthy, there are less documented emerging techniques in Bio-Medical Engineering that are worthy of exploration. For example the automated analysis of the Vector-Cardiogram has yet to replace the analysis of EKG sheets done by hand/eye. Check out other posts on this blog exploring Vector-Cardiograms.

These notes are a little bit of investigation (and rudimentary background information) into some alternate techniques. As well as some less relevant notes.
