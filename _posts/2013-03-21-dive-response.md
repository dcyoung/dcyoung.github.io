## Abstract

Dive response is a natural mechanism of the body in response to being submerged in water. The autonomic response consists of rapidly induced bradycardia as well as vasoconstriction of the peripheral vessels, both of which aid in the preservation of body heat and oxygen. In this lab the common effects of dive response were monitored under simulated dive conditions, breath-holding conditions and normal breathing conditions. Heart rate and pulse amplitude were monitored using a finger pulse transducer and changes in peripheral circulation were calculated using a sphygmomanometer and a respiratory belt. It was found that both heart rate and peripheral circulation were reduced in the breathholding and even more so in the dive conditions than under normal breathing.
