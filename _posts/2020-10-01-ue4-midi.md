I dug this project off an old hard drive. I had thrown it together in an afternoon a few years ago and it seemed relevant, so I tried to record some of it. The original idea was to explore how one could connect a game engine with real time MIDI information coming from external instruments and applications. The proof of concept was simple: create a virtual keyboard :)

- Entirely blueprint based - blueprints are UE4's take on visual scripting. Coding this would have been far easier, but debugging blueprints is a music visualization itself.
- A MIDI event manager to receives incoming MIDI events (note onset/offset/velocity etc.)
- Procedurally generated keyboard mesh - each key is linked to a corresponding MIDI value
- Object scale and emissive materials will react to the incoming signals

This is already a blast to sit in front of while playing, and I'm excited to extend this pattern to control more exciting behavior in a virtual world.

PS: For any of those interested, just improvising over some 2-5-1 in C#.
