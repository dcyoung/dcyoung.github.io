Although I rarely have the time to game, I still maintain a strong interest in games as an industry, an art and a medium. My first console was an original Xbox. A few years later I started installing Xbox modchips so friends and I could experiment with modding games like Halo. Later, Bungie released a game called Destiny which I appreciated for its deep movement mechanics and an absolutely wonderful community. As a fun introduction to video editing, I created gameplay montages including some of my own gameplay and one for a friend - he's much better :)
