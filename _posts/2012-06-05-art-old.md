## Blue Tape Murals

My freshman year of college I asked if I could re-paint my dorm room door because the paint was chipping off in large sections.  I was told I wasn't allowed to use paint, but I could cover the marks in Blue Tape.  I didn't find the suggestion terribly helpful, but I did decide to run with the Blue Tape idea... and so the "Blue Tape Mural" was born.  I thought it would be a simple afternoon project, but word got around. Because no students were permitted to paint the walls or hang pictures with nails, it turned out that blue tape was the most viable medium for artistic expression. I started receiving more requests than I could handle. At first I considered providing the service as commissioned work, but time constraints limited it to favors for about a dozen friends. I was never very big on documenting or photographing my work until I started this site, and because all this was years ago I only have a few pictures left floating around on old smart phones. But it should convey the idea. Its a very neat and reversible way to decorate a wall, even if it is a bummer having to take them down come summer.

## Pastel Concentration Piece

A few years back I did a concentration on my sister and her dog. A bit random, but stranger concentrations certainly exist :)  I was attempting to explore the capabilities of pastels, specifically in conveying natural forms and physical delineations with somewhat un-intuitive groupings of contrasting colors. For example, the strange colors one wouldn't expect to see on the white muzzle of a dog, or the white of the eye can actually come together to produce a very realistic image without the viewer even realizing they're looking at rather distinct colors.

## Charcoal Exploration

This piece was done as part of the concentration, but it was really more of an excuse to attempt a very large scale charcoal experiment.  I was looking to see if I could indicate subtle color changes with only charcoal. I took an image and blobbed out its colors using photoshop, and then did my best to correlate those to a gray scale. The result turned out well and the picture is truly enormous.

## Another Pastel Concentration Piece

This piece was part of the concentration, but I also intended to give it to my sister as a gift. Because of this, I chose a photo that focused mainly on her dog, despite the real interesting work being her shirt and hand.

## Random Unsorted Pieces

This is a gallery of random pieces I happened to have old photographs of.  There are many more that I don't have photographed. The mediums used include charcoal, pastel, prisma color marker, watercolors, expo whiteboard marker, spray paint, photographs, tattoo designs and blue tape.
