I needed to use `numpy` in a Fusion 360 python script recently, and was surprised how tricky it was to manage python environments associated w/ Fusion360. The [recommended method](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-743C88FB-CA3F-44B0-B0B9-FCC378D0D782#Additional%20Python%20Modules) from Autodesk is to install a local version of the Module alongside your script. This works ok for simple native python modules, but breaks down in more complex scenarios. Using local import paths disturbs inter-module dependencies, and often breaks with complex modules containing compiled code (ex: numpy). The easiest alternative solution I came up with was to allow Fusion360's registered python and environment to handle the install by executing from a shell in Fusion360 itself. A bit hacky, but works:

First open the "Text Commands View" in Fusion360. You can find it under `File->View->Show Text Commands`:

> Once the "Text Commands View" is open, make sure the `py` radio button is enabled in the bottom right

Enter the following commands to install a module (ex: `numpy`):

```bash
import sys
import subprocess
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "--upgrade", "numpy"])
```

Now you can use that module in scripts/addins as you normal. For example:

```py
import numpy as np
```
