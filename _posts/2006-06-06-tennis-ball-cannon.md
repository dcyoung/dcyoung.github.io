Using some PVC pieces, a sprinkler valve and a couple shrader valves I was able to whip together a pretty cool pneumatic tennis ball launcher. It has a large chamber that can be pumped up using a pair of bike pumps (or an air compressor) and a simple trigger mechanism to release the air into the barrel. Power can be adjusted by the pressure. At ~50psi it can launch a tennis ball directly upward and out of sight. It should hold anything under 100psi just fine, but I never saw a need to go that far. All in all it was a fun project.
