In my Quantitative Physiology course, there were a few few labs dealing with frog muscles. I frequently encountered issues with excised frog muscles being too large to fit in the existing muscle holders provided in lab. I designed a simple version to be larger, with a notch for a joint to be left intact without requiring the careful dissection of different muscles that could destroy test samples. This removed the need to restrain the muscle with a zip tire or something similar which also helped increase the accuracy of measurements by removing interference with the muscle. The design had to be compatible with the existing placement of pre-bent electrodes for stimulus of sciatic nerves. I kept the design as blocked and simple as possible for reliability when 3D printing.
