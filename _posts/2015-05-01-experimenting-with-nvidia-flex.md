Nvidia Flex is a particle based physics library separate from PhysX. I experimented a little bit with creating interactive fluids using the Nvidia Gameworks branch of Unreal Engine 4. This was months and months ago (Ue4 v4.9 I beleive).   I tried to reopen the project but it seems like a lot of stuff degraded since I was last working on it. There are missing textures and the fluid rendering doesn't look nearly as smooth as it did before. But I snagged some short videos anyways. I should grab a more updated branch and tinker with it again.
