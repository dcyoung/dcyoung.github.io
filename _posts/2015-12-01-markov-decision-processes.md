This project was completed as part of a group assignment for a course at UIUC. I played a large role in the conceptualizing the problem, selecting and designing suitable equations/algorithms to implement and creating the write-up below. Abnormally however, I did not play a large role in coding the implemented solution. While the code provided works, I do not stand strongly behind its architecture, coherence or style.
