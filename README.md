# Personal Blog ![Release](https://github.com/dcyoung/dcyoung.github.io/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

This repository hosts the code for my personal [blog](https://dcyoung.github.io).

The website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) — a static site generator written in Python — and uses a theme based on [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).

### Preview the Website

You can serve the generated site so it can be previewed in your browser using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

And you should see the blog if you visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Hosting

This blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Continuous integration builds the site everytime the source is updated.
